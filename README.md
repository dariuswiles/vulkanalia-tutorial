# Vulkanalia Demo Code

Vulkanalia is a Rust crate that implements a lightweight wrapper around the Vulkan graphics API
(which is a C++ API). This repo contains the code I pieced together by following its
[excellent tutorial](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia/). I say "pieced together" rather than
"wrote" because the tutorial consists of code snippets with copious explanation, so the non-comment
program code is almost all from the tutorial. The comments are mostly my notes based on my
understanding of the explanations.

The _viking_room.obj_ and _viking_room.png_ files in the _resources_ directory are based on the
[Viking Room model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/viking-room-a49f1b8e4f5c4ecf9e1fe7d81915ad38)
on the [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) website. The original model was created by 
[nigelgoh](https://sketchfab.com/nigelgoh) and released under a
[CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license. The tutorials slightly
modified this model, but I have personally made no changes.

I am releasing all other files under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE.txt) because most of the non-comment code is from the Vulkanalia
tutorial which uses this license.
