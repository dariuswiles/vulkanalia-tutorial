# Vulkanalia Demo Code

Vulkanalia is a Rust crate that implements a lightweight wrapper around the Vulkan graphics API
(which is a C++ API). This repo contains the code I pieced together by following its
[excellent tutorial](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia/). I say "pieced together" rather than
"wrote" because the tutorial consists of code snippets with copious explanation, so the non-comment
program code is almost all from the tutorial. The comments are mostly my notes based on my
understanding of the explanations.
